### Example

```
SELECT * FROM order_items \
  LEFT OUTER JOIN orders \
  ON order_items.order_id = orders.id
```

Joins are typically added to `SELECT` statements to add more columns and records.

### Diagram

```
SELECT * FROM `A` INNER JOIN `B`
```

```
┌────────┐
│ A  ┌───┼────┐
│    │ ∩ │    │
└────┼───┘  B │
     └────────┘
```

| Join             | What            |
| ----             | ----            |
| Inner join       | `∩`             |
| Left outer join  | `A` + `∩`       |
| Right outer join | `∩` + `B`       |
| Full outer join  | `A` + `∩` + `B` |
